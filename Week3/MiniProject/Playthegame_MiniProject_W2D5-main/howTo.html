# Project Coloring

# First Part

# HTML File/CSS file
1. In the body, we create 2 sections (it can be also 2 divs)
1. id="pallet"
2. id="canvas"
2. id="pallet" -> be a grid with 3 columns, 8 rows.
The button with a specific id="clear" so we can style this one differently. We will use span
(grid-template-rows,grid-template-columns)

3. id="canvas" -> be a grid with 60 columns, 24 rows, some gap


# JS File
1. For the pallet
-> we could do an array of colors
* loop trough the array of colors, in each loop we create a div,
we give to the div a background-color and a border black
* and we append the div to the relevant section
* for each div we could add a class
* border: 2px solid black

2. For the canvas
-> 24 rows
-> 60 columns
* loop, range is 24x60, in each loop we create a div,
we give to the div a background-color white
* the section canvas will have a background color grey
* and we append the div to the relevant section

# Second part

# JS FILE


IN YOUR JS FILE YOU HAVE
2 LOOPS : ONE TO CREATE THE COLORS PALLET
ONE TO CREATE THE BOXES OF THE CANVAS



1. Pallet
When I create the pallet, do it through a loop --> in this loop, we create a div for each color

* when I create the div, we add an addEventListener("click", retrieveColor)

* retrieve color needs to retrieve the background colo of the color I clicked
function retrieveColor(){
divThatIclicked.backgroundColor
}
==> event object, will give me the target that I clicked on
==> need to hold/store the backgroundColor of the div I clicked on
-> we need to create a variable to store the color I clicked
-> we need to create a global variable


----------------------

2. Canvas
When I create the canvas, do it through a loop --> in this loop, we create a div for box of the canvas
* when I create the div, we add an addEventListener("click", paint)
* the paint functions, changes the background color of the box I clicked on
==> event object, will give me the target that I clicked on

//global scope
let username;

//local scope
function hello(){
username = "John"

}

//local scope
function helloTwo(){
console.log(username)

}

----

3. Clear
-> when we click on the clear button, the background color of EACH DIV of the canvas becomes white
When I created all the divs of the canvas, I can give to each div a class
-> to retrieve all the div -> getElementsByClassName
-> loop -> change the background color of each div to white

---

4. Paint while moving the mouse
Use the event
mouseDown
mouseOver
-> paint

contrary is mouseUp

if mouseDown and mouseOver => paint
else if mouseUp => NO paint


1. I need to add an addEventListener on every box of the canvas
-> addEventListener("mouseDown", mouseDownCallback)
-> addEventListener("mouseOver", mouseOverCallback)
-> addEventListener("mouseUp", mouseUpCallback)

A)
<!-- global variable -->
let isMouseDown = false;

B)
When the mouseDownCallback will be called -> set isMouseDown to true;

C)
In the mouseOverCallback, we need to add
some conditinal to check if the mouse is down by checking the value
of the variable isMouseDown
If isMouseDown is true -> paint

D)
In the mouseUpCallback
set isMouseDown to false
